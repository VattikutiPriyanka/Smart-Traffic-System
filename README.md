Smart Traffic Management System Using YOLOv8 and Fuzzy Logic

This project presents an intelligent real-time traffic management system that combines deep learning (YOLOv8) with fuzzy logic to dynamically optimize traffic signal timings. The system processes live video streams to detect vehicles, classify traffic density (low, medium, high), and adjust green-light durations based on real-time road conditions. Fuzzy logic is used to handle uncertainty in vehicle counts, ensuring smooth and adaptive traffic flow even during unpredictable traffic patterns.

The system offers a significant improvement over traditional fixed-cycle traffic lights by introducing:

1. Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8

2. Fuzzy logic–based decision-making for handling imprecise data

3. Dynamic green-light optimization to reduce congestion

4. Performance accuracy of 90% with strong precision, recall, and F1 scores

5. Scalability across multiple intersections

This work demonstrates how AI and fuzzy control can be combined to greatly enhance urban traffic efficiency, reduce waiting times, minimize congestion, and support smart city infrastructure.
